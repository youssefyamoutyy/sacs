                    <p class="mb-5">
                      Global population demographics demonstrate a constant shift towards older age groups as the fertility rate declines and life expectancy rises. Though most older adults prefer to stay at home, this shift has nonetheless increased the pressure on existing aging care facilities having fixed capacity. Especially, shortages of staff after the pandemic have made the situation worse. Therefore, there has been an urgency to develop an intelligent IoT-based environment inside one’s own house so that older adults can avail all the facilities of an aging care home while residing at their own house independently.
                     
                    <p>
                      Though it is fascinating to see an older adult aging independently in his own home under the umbrella of smart technologies, a flaw in technology can have different levels of impact on the resident’s life, e.g., it can even lead to death. Lesser information processing capabilities of older adults’ minds add more to the vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is critical to identify, assess, analyze and fix the vulnerable aspects of Smart Aging Care Systems (SACS).

                      In this project, we intend to cover the following four major topics:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                      <li>Surveying the security aspects of the existing SACS.
                      </li>
                      <li>Analyzing the risk associated with the most critical assets of SACS.
                      </li>
                      <li>Detecting the attacks on SACS and providing the necessary countermeasures.
                      </li>
                      <li>Preparing a document for regulatory bodies detailing security evaluation criteria for SACS.
                      </li>
                      </ol>

                    <h2 class="tm-section-title tm-color-primary mb-5">How will this project help Canadians?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                      According to the Canadian Government report, in 2014, over 6 million Canadians were aged 65 or older, representing 15.6 percent of Canada's population. By 2030- in less than two decades, seniors will number over 9.5 million and makeup 23 percent of Canadians.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In 2011, 92 percent of older adults in Canada lived in a private home. Economic Action Plan 2013 included a commitment of more than $1.25 billion over five years for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) Affordable Housing Centre. The Centre has created more than 25 000 affordable housing units since 2006, including 43 percent units for seniors.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                     Moreover, the tie between the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007 reflects that the Government is committed to age-friendly communities across Canada so that older adults can gracefully age in place.  
                    </p>

                    <p>In this period of the pandemic, while there is a growing demand for SACS than ever before, little focus has been made on assessing the security risk of this technology. </p>

                    <p> We are committed to developing a security framework through this project that will make SACS a risk-free and much safer zone for the Canadian older adults who can age independently in place and age safely, thus contributing to the Canadian Government’s objective.</p>

                          <p class="mb-5">
                          Our project intends to produce the following outcomes, which are not covered well by the existing studies in this direction. <br>
                          Firstly, after an extensive literature review, we have found a lack of work capturing the holistic view of SACS. Our survey work, along with in-depth analysis, intends to fill that gap.<br>
                          Humans are the weakest link in cyber security. Furthermore, the age factor of older adults only exacerbates the situation. Therefore, compared to the other IoT-based smart frameworks (e.g., smart home, smart industry, etc.), SACS becomes more vulnerable to security threats with an elevated risk. This fact provides the foundation for the second contribution.
                          <br>
                          In this second phase of work, we will assess the risk in SACS, make the security solutions more user-friendly for the elderly, and produce a document for regulatory bodies detailing security evaluation criteria for SACS.
